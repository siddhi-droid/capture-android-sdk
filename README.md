## Example Project
- Please refer to the sample app provided in the repo to get an understanding of the implementation process.
- To run the app, clone/download the repo and open **sample** using latest version of Android Studio
- Open project build.gradle and replace **aws_access_key** and **aws_secret_pass** with the credentials provided by HyperVerge
- Build and run the app

## Integration Steps

### 1. Adding the SDK to your project
- Add the following set of lines to your `app/build.gradle`

  ```groovy
  android {
      defaultConfig {
          renderscriptTargetApi 19
          renderscriptSupportModeEnabled true
	  }
  }
  dependencies {
      implementation('co.hyperverge:hypersnapsdk:2.3.4@aar', {
          transitive=true
          exclude group: 'com.android.support'
      })
  }
  ```
- Add the following set of lines to the Project (top-level) `build.gradle`

  ```groovy
  allprojects {
      repositories {
          maven {
              url "s3://hvsdk/android/releases"
              credentials(AwsCredentials) {
                  accessKey aws_access_key
                  secretKey aws_secret_pass
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  where **aws_access_key** and **aws_secret_pass** will be given by HyperVerge

### 2. App Permissions
-  The app requires the following permissions to work.
    - *Camera*
    - *Autofocus*
    - *Fine Location* (Optional - If geo-tagging data has to be encoded with the images captured )

    Kindly note that for android v23 (Marshmallow) and above, you need to handle the runtime permissions inside your app.

### 3. Initializing the SDK
- Add the following line to your Application class (the class which extends android.app.Application) for initializing our Library. This must be run only once. Check [this](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Understanding-the-Android-Application-Class) link if you are unsure of what an Application class is.
  ```java
  HyperSnapSDK.init(context, APP_ID, APP_KEY, region, product);
  ```
	Where,
	- appId, appKey are given by HyperVerge
	- region: This is an enum, `HyperSnapParams.Region` with three values - `AsiaPacific`, `India` and `UnitedStates`.
	- product: This is an enum, `HyperSnapParams.Product` with two values - `faceID` annd `faceIAM`. Right now, only `faceID` is supported.

### 4. Launching the Activities

#### For Document Capture
 For capturing documents (based on Aspect Ratio), following method should be called:

  ```java
  HVDocConfig hvDocConfig = new HVDocConfig();
  hvDocConfig.setShouldShowReviewScreen(true);
  hvDocConfig.setShouldShowInstructionPage(true);
  hvDocConfig.setShouldShowFlashIcon(true);
  hvDocConfig.setShouldAddPadding(true);
  hvDocConfig.setDocumentType(document);
  hvDocConfig.setDocCaptureDescription("Make sure your document is without any glare and is fully inside");
  hvDocConfig.setDocCaptureSubText("Front side");
  HVDocsActivity.start(context, hvDocConfig, myCaptureCompletionListener);
  ```
  where:
  - **context**: is the context of the current Activity being displayed.
  -  **myCaptureCompletionListener**: is an object of `CaptureCompletionHandler` and has been described  [later](#CaptureCompletionHandler).
  - **hvDocConfig**: This is an object of type `HVDocConfig`. Its properties can be set with the setter methods provided for them. These are the various properties provided:
    - **setDocumentType**: (Document) Document is an enum of type   `HVDocConfig.Document`. It specifies the document type that needs to be captured.The parameter can be initialized as follows:
        ```java
        Document document = Document.CARD;
        ```
      - Following are the types of documents supported by the Document enum:

          - **CARD**: Aspect ratio: 0.625. Example: Vietnamese National ID, Driving License, Motor Registration Certificate.
          - **PASSPORT**: Aspect ratio: 0.67. Example: Passports
          - **A4**: Aspect ratio: 1.4. Example: Bank statement, insurance receipt.
          - **OTHER**: This is for aspect ratios that don't fall in the above categories. In this case, the aspect ratio should be set in the next line by calling `document.setAspectRatio(aspectRatio);`
    	    where `aspectRatio` is a float specifying the aspectRatio of the document.
    
    - **setShouldShowReviewScreen**: (Boolean) To determine if the document review page should be shown after capture page. It defaults to `false`.
    - **setShouldShowInstructionPage**: (Boolean) To determine if the instructions page should be shown before capture page. It defaults to `false`.
    - **setShouldShowFlashIcon**: (Boolean) Setting this to true will add a flash toggle button at the top right corner of the screen. It defaults to `false`.
    - **setShouldAddPadding**: (Boolean) Setting this to true will enable extra padding that will be added to all images captured using the Document Capture activity. It defaults to `true`.
    -  **setDocCaptureTitle**: (String) To set the title text that is shown in the document capture page. 
    - **setDocReviewTitle**: (String) To set the title text that is shown in the Review screen after a document has been captured.
    - **setDocReviewDescription**: (String) To set the instruction text that is shown in the Review screen after a document has been captured.   
     - **setDocCaptureDescription**: (String) The text displayed at the top section of the Camera Preview in HVDocsActivity. This is to communicate the positioning of the document to the user.
     
    - **setDocCaptureSubText**: (String) The text displayed at the bottom end of the Camera Preview in HVDocsActivity. It is meant to tell the user about the document type.
        	  

#### For Face Capture
For capturing face image, following method should be called:
  ```java
  HVFaceConfig hvFaceConfig = new HVFaceConfig();
  hvFaceConfig.setLivenessMode(LivenessMode.MODE);
  hvFaceConfig.setFaceCaptureTitle("Face capture");
  HVFaceActivity.start(context, hvFaceConfig, myCaptureCompletionListener);
  ```
  where:
  - **context**: is the context of the current Activity being displayed
  - **myCaptureCompletionListener**: is an object of `CaptureCompletionHandler` and has been described [later](#CaptureCompletionHandler).
  - **hvFaceConfig**: This is an object of type `HVFaceConfig`. Its properties can be set with the setter methods provided for them. These are the various properties provided:
    - **setLivenessMode**: (HVFaceConfig.LivenessMode) Explained [later](#Liveness-in-Face-Capture).
    - **setClientID**: (String) This is an optional parameter that could be sent with the liveness call.
    - **setShouldShowInstructionPage**: (Boolean) To determine if the instructions page should be shown before capture page. It defaults to `false`.
    - **setFaceCaptureTitle**: (String) It allows to modify the title text that is shown in HVFaceActivity.
    - **enableDataLogging**: (Boolean) This will allow Hyperverge to log the data to facilitate easy debugging and analysis. It defaults to `false`. 

#### CaptureCompletionHandler
CaptureCompletionHandler is an interface whose object needs to be passed with start method of both HVFaceActivity and HVDocsActivity. It has methods which has to be implemented by the object to handle both the responses of document capture and the errors that occured during capture. Following is a sample implementation of CaptureCompletionHandler:
  ```java
  CaptureCompletionHandler myCaptureCompletionListener = new CaptureCompletionHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(Error error, JSONObject result) {
        if(error != null) {
            Log.e("LandingActivity", error.getError() + " :: " + error.getErrMsg());
        }
        else{
            Log.i("Landing Activity", result.toString());
            //result will have following keys:
            //    â€¢ imageUri: String path of the captured image
        }
    }
  }
  ```
  

#### Liveness in Face Capture
The SDK has two liveness detection methods. Texture liveness and Gesture Liveness. This can be set using the `livenessMode` parameter in the `setLivenessMode` method of `HVFaceConfig` discussed earlier.

Here, `livenessMode` is of type `HVFaceConfig.LivenessMode`, an enum with 3 values:

**.none**: No liveness test is performed. The selfie that is captured is simply returned. If successful, the result JSON in the CaptureCompletionHandler has one key-value pair.
- `imageUri`: local path of the image captured.

**.textureLiveness**: Texture liveness test is performed on the selfie captured.  If successful, a result JSON with the following key-value pairs is returned in the CaptureCompletionHandler.

- `imageUri`: String. Local path of the image captured.
- `live`: String with values 'yes'/'no'. Tells whether the selfie is live or not.
- `liveness-score`: Float with values between 0 and 1.The  confidence score for the liveness prediction.
- `to-be-reviewed`: String with values 'yes'/'no'. Yes indicates that it flagged for manual review.

**.textureAndGestureLiveness**: In this mode, based on the results of the texture Liveness call, the user might be asked to do a series of gestures to confirm liveness. This mode is currently in beta. It is highly recommended to not use it in production.



## API Calls 

### OCR API Call
 To make OCR API calls directly from the App, use the following method:
 ```java
    HVNetworkHelper.makeOCRCall(endpoint, documentUri, parameters, completionCallback)
 ```
 where:
   - **endpoint**: (String) Please check out the links given below.
        - For India KYC please check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/hyperverge/kyc-india-rest-api)
        - For Vietnam KYC please check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/hyperverge/kyc-vietnam-rest-api)
   - **parameters**: (JSONObject) This is usually an empty JSON Object. If you want HyperVerge to temporarily store the image for debugging purposes, please set "outputImageUrl" to "yes". Find more details [here](https://github.com/hyperverge/kyc-india-rest-api#optional-parameters).
   - **documentUri**: (String) The `imageUri` received in the completionHandler after Document Capture.
   - **completionCallback**: (APICompletionCallback) This is an interface which is used to return the results back after making the network request.Explained [here](#apicompletioncallback).     
       
### Face Match Call
 To make Face ID match call directly from the App, use the following method:
  ```java
     HVNetworkHelper.makeFaceMatchCall(endPoint, faceUri, documentUri, parameters, completionCallback)
  ``` 
  
  where:
   * **endpoint**: (String) 
   
	   *	India: "https://ind.faceid.hyperverge.co/v1/photo/verifyPair"
		* Asia Pacific: "https://apac.faceid.hyperverge.co/v1/photo/verifyPair"
   	
For more information, please check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/hyperverge/face-match-rest-api)
   * **parameters**: (JSONObject)
	   * *type*: (required)For document to selfie match, please set "type" to "id". For selfie to selfie match, set "type" to "selfie".
		* *dataLogging*: (optional)If you want HyperVerge to store your image for debugging purpose, set "dataLogging" to "yes".
		* *clientId*: (optional) This is a unique identifier that is assigned to the end customer by the API user. It would be the same for the different API calls made for the same customer. This would facilitate better analysis of user flow etc.
	
   * **faceUri**: (String) The `imageUri` received in the CompletionHandler after Face Capture.
   * **documentUri**: (String) The `imageUri` received in the completionHandler after Document Capture.
   * **completionCallback**: (APICompletionCallback) This is an interface which is used to return the results back after making the network request. Explained [here](#apicompletioncallback).     
         

#### APICompletionCallback
APICompletionCallback is an interface whose object needs to be passed with 'makeOCRCall' or 'makeFaceMatchCall'. It has one `onResult` method that contains the error or result obtained in the process. 

Following is a sample implementation of APICompletionCallback:
  ```java
  APICompletionCallback completionCallback = new APICompletionCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(JSONObject error, JSONObject result) {
        if(error != null) {
            Log.e("Log", error.toString());
        }
        else{
            Log.i("Log", result.toString());
        }
    }
  }
  ```  
  Where,
  
 - **result**: The result JSONObject is the entire result obtained by the API without any modification.
 
 - **error**: The error JSONObject two key-value pairs.
 	- 'error' : Error message
	- 'statusCode' : ErrorCode(if error is returned by SDK) or StatusCode(if error is returned by the server).
	
**Errors Returned by the SDK**: Network Error(102), Initialization Error(101) and Internal SDK Error(2).<br/>

**Errors Returned by the Server**: For error messages and status codes returned by the server, please refer to the corresponding API documentation.


## Error Codes
Descriptions of the error codes returned in the CaptureCompletionHandler and CompletionCallback are given here. 


|Description|Explanation|Action|
|-----------|-----------|------|
|2|Internal SDK Error|Occurs when an unexpected error has happened with the HyperSnapSDK.|Notify HyperVerge|
|3|Operation Cancelled By User|When the user taps on cancel button before capture|Try again.|
|4|Camera Permission Denied|Occurs when the user has denied permission to access camera.|In the settings app, give permission to access camera and try again.|
|101|Initialization Error|Occurs when SDK has not been initialized properly.|Make sure HyperSnapSDK.initialise method is called before using the capture functionality|
|102|Network Error|Occurs when the internet is either non-existant or very patchy.|Check internet and try again. If Internet is proper, contact HyperVerge|
|103|Authentication Error|Occurs when the request to the server could not be Authenticated/Authorized.|Make sure appId and appKey set in the initialization method are correct|
|104|Internal Server Error|Occurs when there is an internal error at the server.|Notify HyperVerge|
|201|Face Match Error|Occurs when one or more faces captured in the gestures flow do not match the selfie|This is equivalent to liveness fail. Take corresponding action|
|202|Face Detection Error|Occurs when a face couldn't be detected in an image by the server|Try capture again|

            ```
### EXIF Data
Both Face and Document images returned by the SDK have EXIF data stored in them.
If the app has permissions to access location, the EXIF data would also contain the 'GPS' data of the image.
Please note that, if GPS data is needed, location permissions should be handled by the app before launching the SDK.

To get the EXIF data, use the following code on the `imageUri` returned by the SDK
 ```
	  ExifInterface outFile = new ExifInterface(imageUri);
      String gpsLongitude = outFile.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_GPS_LONGITUDE);
	  String gpsLatitude  = outFile.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_GPS_LATITUDE);
      String make = outFile.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_MAKE);
      String model = outFile.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_MODEL);
	  String flash = outFile.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_FLASH);
	  String focalLength = outFile.getAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_FOCAL_LENGTH);

 ```
